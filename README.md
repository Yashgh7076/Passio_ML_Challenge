# Passio_ML_Challenge

This is a repository for the Passio ML-Docker Challenge

1) The goal of this challenge is to append layers to a MobileNetV2 model such that it outputs L2 normed unit vectors, and store this model to disk.
 
2) The python script is to be built using a docker image.

3) Using this image, a docker container is then run and the working directory inside the container is mounted to the present working directory on the local host machine.

4) Upon successful execution you should see 'my_second_tx_model.h5' in your present working directory.
